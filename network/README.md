# Networking with Node.js

In this section, I cover networking with Node.js. You can find examples and explanations on how to create a simple TCP server and client in this README.

Feel free to explore the examples and learn how to build networking applications with Node.js.

## TCP Server

The TCP server example demonstrates how to create a simple TCP server using Node.js. The server listens on a specified port and handles incoming connections from clients.

To run the TCP server example, follow these steps:

1. Run the TCP server:

   ```bash
    node simple-tcp-server.js
   ```

2. The server will start listening on port `3000`.

3. You can connect to the server using a TCP client.

## TCP Client

The TCP client example demonstrates how to create a simple TCP client using Node.js. The client connects to a TCP server and sends a message to the server.

To run the TCP client example, follow these steps:

1. Run the TCP client:

   ```bash
    node simple-tcp-client.js
   ```

2. The client will connect to the server running on `localhost:3000`.

3. You can send a message to the server by typing it in the terminal.

Feel free to explore the TCP server and client examples and customize them according to your needs.

For more information on networking with Node.js, you can refer to the official [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html).

I hope you find these examples helpful in understanding how to work with networking in Node.js. Happy coding!
