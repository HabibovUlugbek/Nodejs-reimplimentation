# Streams in Node.js

Streams are a fundamental concept in Node.js that allow for efficient handling of data, especially when dealing with large amounts of information. In this repository, we will explore the usage of streams by benchmarking different stream implementations, creating custom streams, and ultimately building an encrypt/decrypt project using transform streams.

## Benchmarking Streams

To understand the performance characteristics of different stream implementations, we will conduct benchmarking tests. By comparing the speed and memory usage of various stream types, we can make informed decisions about which streams are best suited for specific use cases.

## Creating Custom Streams

In addition to exploring built-in streams, we will also dive into creating our own custom streams. Custom streams provide flexibility and allow us to tailor the data processing to our specific needs. We will explore both readable and writable custom streams, leveraging the power of Node.js stream APIs.

## Encrypt/Decrypt Project using Transform Streams

To demonstrate the practical application of streams, we will build an encrypt/decrypt project using transform streams. Transform streams allow us to modify data as it passes through the stream pipeline. By leveraging encryption algorithms, we can securely encrypt and decrypt data in real-time, providing a valuable tool for data protection.

Stay tuned as we dive deeper into the world of streams and explore their vast potential in Node.js!
