# Node.js Modules Reimplementation

This repository aims to provide reimplementation of popular Node.js modules, showcasing how they can be used with real examples. In this repo, we will cover the reimplementation of modules: `event` and `fs` and also you can see usage of buffer.

## Event Module Reimplementation

The `event` module is a core module in Node.js that allows you to create and handle custom events. In this reimplementation, we have created a simplified version of the `event` module.

Feel free to explore the reimplementation and customize it according to your needs.

For more information on the `event` module reimplementation, please refer to the [README](./events-module/README.md) in the `events-module` folder.

## FS Module Usage: File Commander

The `fs` module is a core module in Node.js that provides an API for interacting with the file system. In this repository, we have implemented a file commander application that demonstrates various use cases of the `fs` module.

The file commander allows you to perform operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting files and directories. It also provides functionality for renaming files.

Feel free to explore the file commander and customize it according to your needs.

For more information on the file commander and its usage with the `fs` module, please refer to the [README](./file-commander/README.md) in the `file-commander` folder.
