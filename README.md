# Node.js Modules Reimplementation

This repository aims to provide reimplementation of popular Node.js modules, showcasing how they can be used with real examples. In this repo, I will cover the reimplementation of modules: `event` and `fs` and also you can see usage of `buffer` and `streams`.

## Event Module Reimplementation

The `event` module is a core module in Node.js that allows you to create and handle custom events. In this reimplementation, I have created a simplified version of the `event` module.

Feel free to explore the reimplementation and customize it according to your needs.

For more information on the `event` module reimplementation, please refer to the [README](./events-module/README.md) in the `events-module` folder.

## FS Module Usage: File Commander

The `fs` module is a core module in Node.js that provides an API for interacting with the file system. In this repository, I have implemented a file commander application that demonstrates various use cases of the `fs` module.

The file commander allows you to perform operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting files and directories. It also provides functionality for renaming files.

Feel free to explore the file commander and customize it according to your needs.

For more information on the file commander and its usage with the `fs` module, please refer to the [README](./file-commander/README.md) in the `file-commander` folder.

## Streams in Node.js

Streams are a powerful feature in Node.js that allow you to efficiently process and manipulate data. They provide a way to read or write data in chunks, rather than loading the entire data into memory.

In this repository, I also cover the usage of streams. You can find examples and explanations on how to work with streams in the [README](./streams/README.md) in the `streams` folder. I provide examples of working with streams, including benchmarking and a custom stream implementation.

Feel free to explore the examples and learn how to leverage streams in your Node.js projects.

## Social Media and Articles

If you're interested in learning more about the reimplementation of the `event` and `fs` modules, as well as the usage of `buffer` and `streams`, here are some resources you can explore:
